Subject: [Pdf4tcl-users] tables
Message-ID: <432047230903040610q40dc6cey9b83538047443cfd@mail.gmail.com>

Created little function to help creating tables.
Currently i added this to pdf4tcl namespace as method but it can be
easily converted to separate function.
At moment lot of things hardcoded and hopefully in some day they can
be changed via args.
for using this extension line must be added after "snit::type
pdf4tcl::pdf4tcl {"
source /path_to_tcl_package/table.tcl

probably its easier to use package require but i'm using older
aolserver so its easier for me to just source files.

example:
- - - -
set str "<tr><td>bla</td><td>komm</td></tr><tr><td>asd</td><td>hjgkljlkj</td></tr>"
set str [mypdf html2table $str]
mypdf create_pdf_table $str
- - - -
or just
set str { { bla } { komm } } { { asd } { hjgkljlkj } }
